# Preface

We are all going to die.

1. **Choose a north star. Look outside yourself.**
1. **Don't become the thing you resist.**
1. **Study nonviolence.**
1. **Don't do it for power. Do it for the benefit.**

  Ego kills.

1. **Nothing always works.**
1. **Believe and be open to changing what you believe.**
1. **Work with what you have where you are.**
1. **Never reach your destination, but track your progress.**

  We are never done. The fight freedom, justice, and equality is never won.

1. **Prefer public. Private implies deceit or deception.**
1. **Always suspect authority.**

  Authority are people who tell you how to act, think, or believe. Never *trust* authority, even if you choose to comply. There is no exception to this rule.

1. **Prefer talking in person, face to face.**

1. **Follow the money. Who pays, who benefits, and who decides?**
