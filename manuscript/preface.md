# Preface

> My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. &mdash; Maya Angelou

We are all going to die.

Resistance starts in your mind.

1. **Choose a north star. Look outside yourself.**

1. **Don't become the thing you resist.**

1. **Study nonviolence.**
1. **Don't do it for power. Do it for the benefit.**

  Ego kills.

1. **Nothing always works.**
1. **Everything is a two-edged sword.**

  Every strength is also a weakness. Every benefit is also a drawback.

1. **Believe and be open to changing what you believe.**

  > It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so. &mdash; Mark Twain

1. **Work with what you have where you are.**

1. **Never reach your destination, but track your progress.**

  We are never done. The fight for freedom, justice, and equality is never won.

1. **Prefer public. Private implies deceit or deception.**
1. **Always suspect authority.**

  Authority are people who tell you how to act, think, or believe. Never *trust* authority, even if you choose to comply. There is no exception to this rule.

1. **Prefer talking in person, face to face.**

1. **Follow the money. Who pays, who benefits, and who decides?**

  > Sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple &mdash; Dr. Seuss

1. **Choose to be a realistic optimist.**

> All the forces in the world are not so powerful as an idea whose time has come. &mdash; Victor Hugo

> Nothing pleases people more than to go on thinking what they have always thought, and at the same time imagine that they are thinking something new and daring; it combines the advantage of security with the delight of adventure &mdash; TS Eliot

## Why This Book?

> Take what you can use and let the rest go by. &mdash; Ken Kesey
