# Resist Survive Thrive: An Illustrated Manual

This is a hopeful book about a brighter future. It tries to bring things we know from the past to help us build that future right now, in the present. In other words, a lot of what we need to know is already here right now.

If you look around at the state of your world and ask, "But, *what* can we do?", here are some ideas.

Begin the book by reading the [Preface](/manuscript/preface.md).
