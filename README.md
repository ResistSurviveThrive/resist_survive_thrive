# Resist Survive Thrive: An Illustrated Manual

> Those who control the present, control the past and those who control the past control the future. &mdash; George Orwell, 1984

This is a hopeful book about a brighter future, one where everyone experiences health, freedom, equality, and justice. It is the past that contains the seeds of this brighter future. We already know much of what we need. More importantly, we know how to learn what we don't yet know. The most important thing now is to put what we know into action.

If you look around at the state of your world and ask, "But, *what* can we do?", here are some ideas.

Begin the book by reading the [Preface](/manuscript/preface.md).
